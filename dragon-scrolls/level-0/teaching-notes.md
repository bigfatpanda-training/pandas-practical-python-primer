# Teaching Notes for Level-0
- Have students install Vagrant and start the download process
for the Ubuntu image: `vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64`.
    - If you forget to do this you'll be stuck later when everyone is sitting
     and waiting for their downloads to complete.
     
- It's important to set expectations thoroughly with the students because 
of the wide range of skills and background knowledge coming into the class.

- Remember to tell people to get off VPN connections as this may result in 
connection failures when trying to access resources on the web.

- Latest PyCharm bug: not recognizing Vagrant path settings when started
from desktop UI.  Must start from command line with `charm`.  I don't have
a way of telling if this will work for Windows machines.

- Take time to explain the layout of the course materials.
- Use repl.it to complete the Python test question.

- Homework!  Read Code lay-out and Naming Conventions sections of PEP8 and
be prepared to answer questions about it.
