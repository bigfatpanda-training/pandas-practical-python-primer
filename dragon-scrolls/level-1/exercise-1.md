### Idea 1: In Python, Everything is an "Object"
So... Python is an object-oriented language.  You many have heard that term
before.  It's used to group a certain set of languages together that 
have deal with the concept of, tada, objects.

That's great.  So what is an object?  Well, it's a thing. **Oh - thanks a lot! 
That's even less descriptive. (I hate my instructor...)**
  
No, really, objects are just like things in the real world.  In fact, that is
kinda the idea of where they came from.  Take your phone for instance: it's a 
thing that has certain characteristics and can do stuff:
- It has color, shape, size.
- It can call people (who does that anymore?), text people, SnapChat them, etc...
    
It's the same thing with objects, they have characteristics (called 
**attributes**) and things that they can do (called **methods** or **functions**
depending on the context).

So, whenever we are talking about a object(thing) in Python, we can ask
these two questions: 
- What are it's characteristics (attributes)?
- What can it do (methods/functions)?
