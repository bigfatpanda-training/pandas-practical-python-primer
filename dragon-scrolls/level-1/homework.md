## Homework Review
Aha!  You thought that I was going to forget.  **Wrong.**  Let's talk about 
PEP8.

### PEP8
The Python community developed a standardized way to propose enhancements to 
the language fairly early in its history - via PEPs, which is short for 
"Python Enhancement Proposal".  The are incrementally numbered, just like 
a database record.

You can tell then that PEP8 is one of the earliest proposals.  

What is interesting about PEP8 in contrast to some other languages is that
it is really about changing the language (syntax or capabilities) but rather
specifying what is to be considered the Pythonic way of doing something or, 
in more general terms, good practice.

Conformance to PEP8 in your code is one of the first tests that other 
Python programmers will evaluate code by.  If a given piece of code
follows its rules, the reader will know that the writer was:
- Reasonably familiar with Pythonic practices.
- Cared enough to follow it so that others could more easily understand 
the code.

### Test Time
Open `PEP8_STUFF.py` in your `dragon-warrior` folder for this class.  You've 
got 10 minutes to identify and fix all the PEP8 violations in the file.

Good luck!
