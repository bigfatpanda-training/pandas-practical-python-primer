![Welcome to Level 1](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/DVD/Paramount/detailpages/KungFuPanda/KungFuPnda_M1L.jpg)
# Level One: The Zen & Basics of Python
In this level, we will be covering Python community standards, and overview
of Object-Oriented programming terminology, basic Python data structures, 
and setting up PyCharm for your projects.

## Class Setup
Prior to each class, there are a few things to do:
- [Get the latest materials](../level-0/git-merging-upstream-changes.md) 
from my version of the class repository.  
- You may also need to [rebuild to your virtual machine](../level-0/vagrant-cheatsheet.md) 
if I've made a big change to its structure, or if you powered down your machine 
without suspending it (and therefore hosed it).
- [Setup a new project in PyCharm](../level-0/pycharm-project-setup.md).

## Training Topics
In this training level we are going to be talking about the basic building 
blocks of Python.  We'll approach it using only the minimum necessary 
technospeak.

By the end of the training exercises, you should have a surface level
familiarity for most of the things that you'll see in Python code.

Let's get started!
