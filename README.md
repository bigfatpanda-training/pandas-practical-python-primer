# Welcome Dragon Warrior!
Welcome to your beginning Python training course.  Soon you'll be making
your enemies go blind through the pure awesomeness of your code!


## Class Syllabus
Your journey to becoming a dragon warrior will be separated in different 
training levels.  Each level will correspond with one practical use of Python.
* Level-0: [Introductions & System Setup](dragon-scrolls/level-0/readme.md)
* Level-1: [The Basics & Zen of Python](dragon-scrolls/level-1/readme.md)
* Level-2: [Creating Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)](dragon-scrolls/level-2/readme.md)
* Level-3: [Interacting with Web Services](dragon-scrolls/level-3/readme.md)
* Level-4: [Creating Web Services](dragon-scrolls/level-4/readme.md)
* Level-5: [Creating Websites](dragon-scrolls/level-5/readme.md)

## Where Stuff Is
* Instruction materials in the `dragon-scrolls` folder, with subfolders for
each training level.  Inside each level folder is a `readme.md` file which 
will contain links to all the other instructions for that level.

* The code files live in subfolders of `training`.  Just like inside 
`dragon-scrolls`, the subfolders are separated by training levels.
    * In each training level folder (ex. `level-1-command-line-interfaces`)
    you find two additional folders: `bfp-reference` and `dragon-warrior`.
        * `bfp-reference` contains my versions of the code files and exist
        as a reference if you need to copy something over or get behind.
        * `dragon-warrior` is where you will be putting the code that you 
        for each training level.
        
## Getting Help
* The easiest way to get help is to post a message to the class forum.  If 
you haven't already received a message from the forum, you will after you 
register for the class.

* If you are a visitor from the great interwebs, feel free to email me
at mike@eikonomega.com with any questions.
