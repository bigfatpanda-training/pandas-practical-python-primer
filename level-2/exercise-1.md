### Step 1: Create the a Proper Module Outline
* Create a module named: `your_id_business_search.py`
* Add a docstring with information on the API that we'll be interacting with.
    * The docs for the API are available at: [`http://api.searchcompany.us`](http://api.searchcompany.us)
    * Remember that the Pythonic way of doing docstrings in enshrined in [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
* Make the module able to be imported or executed as a script.
   
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
      pass
   ```
* import the `requests` library

   ```python
   """
   your docstring
   """
   
   import requests
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
      pass
   ```
